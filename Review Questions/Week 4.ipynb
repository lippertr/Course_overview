    "In machine learning, decision trees are a series of sequential splitting rules on the features of data that attempt to partition the corresponding labels into homogeneous groups.  Decisions, or splits, are made at nodes on the existing data on one feature and a **splitting_value** in the range of that feature, and data and their corresponding labels flow \"to the left\" or \"to the right\" depending if their value for that feature is equal or not (categorical feature) or <= or > (continuously valued) to the **splitting_value.**  As there are multiple features and multiple values for each feature, there needs to be a way to determine what split at that decision node is \"best.\"  This is done by trying to maximize the information gain associated with that particular split by evaluating the reduction in entropy (classification) or variance (regression) of the label associated with splitting on that feature and its **splitting_value**.  \n",
