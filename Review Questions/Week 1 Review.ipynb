    "        Python does not provide access control, but there are conventions to hide data ie. _x\n",
    "    Polymorphism, methods/operations of same name act differently and approproaitely on different object types\n",
    "        widely used in libraries\n",
    "        treated the same if they support the same interface\n",
    "        python employs 'duck-typing'\n",
    "        if an expected method is missing during execution, Python raises and AttributeError\n",

    "    In programming, there are typically two dominant paradigms to structure code: Functional and Object Oriented. Functional programming eschews mutable state, i.e. variables, and passes information/logic through the input and output of functions. OO programming on the other hand embraces state (i.e. remembering) in the form of variables and objects. For example, if I wanted to write a program that calculates some mathematical results, I might pass intermediate values from one function to the next through an internal variable."
