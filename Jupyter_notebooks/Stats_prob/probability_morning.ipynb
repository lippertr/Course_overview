    " - How well does the data match some assumed (null) distribution [hypothesis testing]?\n",
    " - If it doesn't match well, can we estimate the parameters to approximate it [point estimate]?\n",
    " - How accurate are the parameter estimates [interval estimates]?\n",
    " - Can we model the underlying distribution [function estimates or approximation or machine learning]?\n",

    "We write random variables as capital letters, which is somewhat confusion because we also tend to write sets as capital letters. We can rest (a little) easy knowing that a random variable has within it a set of possible outcomes; in fact, much of the notation used for probability treats the random variable _like a set_. So, it's all cool.\n",

    "So, the random variable is written as a capital letter, cool. We write _specific outcomes_ as lowercase letters. That leads to the following notation:\n",
